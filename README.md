 I created a landing page using HTML(BEM), CSS (Sass), and JavaScript that is not only visually appealing, but also fully responsive.I used HTML to structure the content of the page and CSS(Sass) to style the page.I also used JavaScript to add interactivity to the page, such as form validation, and other user-friendly features.
