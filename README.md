### *Responsive Layout for a Wireless Speakers Website*

In this project, I created a modern, responsive layout for a website showcasing wireless speakers. The project was built using *HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript*, following the *BEM methodology* and utilizing *mixins* for better code readability and scalability.

The entire page structure is based on *CSS Grid*, allowing for precise element positioning and seamless adaptation to different screen resolutions. Additionally, I incorporated *Flexbox* to manage smaller components effectively, ensuring smooth responsiveness across various devices.

The result is a sleek and aesthetically pleasing website that combines intuitive navigation with a dynamic layout, perfectly adjusting to different screen sizes.
