[Figma design](<https://www.figma.com/file/Ujp7bCFuvuJlkn8TSbQPSZ/%E2%84%9611-(kickstarter)?node-id=19655%3A33>) - Use BEM and SCSS

[DEMO LINK](https://daryna-kopytko.github.io/Kickstarter/)

I developed a landing page that easily adapts to any size gadget.
It is easy to operate and has an attractive design.
When using the size for mobile devices, the menu board is hidden
in the side slideout, which simplifies work and maintains a neat appearance
of the page. In this case, the block with slides hides all slides except
one, which keeps the page clean from unnecessary material.
