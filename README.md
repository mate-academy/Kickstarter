# Kickstarter Landing Page

## Project Description

Kickstarter Landing Page is a fully responsive web page created as a pixel-perfect implementation of a Figma design.
This project demonstrates strong front-end development skills, with a focus on layout precision, clean structure, and adaptive behavior across different screen sizes.

The layout adapts seamlessly to various devices and ensures a consistent user experience on:
- **Mobile:** 320px to 734px
- **Tablet:** 743px to 1140px
- **Desktop:** 1140px and above

This project was built as a practice in reproducing modern UI/UX designs using only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
