# Kickstarter landing page
  - I made the website of the museum. The site has a header, menu with navigation, five sections and footer. Also I made slider for blok "features".
- During development, I use:
- - SASS preprocessor;
- - BEM methodology;
- - used grid and flex to place elements;
- - used transition for smooth increase of icons and pictures as links on hover;
- - for slider I used JS, SASS and HTML.

- - The mockup and demo are below.
