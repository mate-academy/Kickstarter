## Tech review

1. Add favicon
2. Add a smooth scroll for the whole page (`scroll-behavior: smooth;`)
3. Menu on mobile should contain navigation links. [Menu example](http://joxi.ru/VrwJRDPcoOzEZA)
4. Logos should become bigger on hover and lead to the first section
5. Icons in the “about us” block should be ***animated*** on hover
6. The arrow icon in the footer should increase when hovering and when clicked smoothly scroll the page to the top
7. Under the button “see more about us”, the strip should stretch to the full width when hovering and lead to the CrazyBaby website
8. All interactive elements(**links, buttons, pictures, icons**) ***should have a hover effect and cursor pointer***. User must intuitively understand that he can interact with them
9. Make sure when you click on logo there is no 404 error (Use `href="#"` in `anchor tag`)
10. When you try to send the form there is no 405 error and the form is automatically cleared after submit and is scrolled to the top of the page or the page is reloaded
11. The form shouldn’t submit empty
12. After autocomplete the form, change the [default styles](http://joxi.ru/xAeW7w9CMp9GPm). Read more about [changing autocomplete styles](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/change-autocomplete-styles-webkit-browsers/)
13. OPTIONAL: After everything is done you can add a slider in the “features” section (for mobile version)

## HR review

1. To make it clear to the recruiter what exactly this landing page is, it is better to give the whole web page the title “CrazyBaby”
2. A landing page is implemented strictly according to the design in Figma
3. Links in the header and menu should lead to the corresponding blocks of the landing page
4. The speed of animations is the same throughout the landing page (for example, increasing when hovering or moving blocks when scrolling)
5. Placeholders in the forms suggest what to enter, and if there is a validation of the form, then it is clear in what format to enter the phone number
6. Make sure everything looks neat on mobile and without horizontal scrolling
7. After clicking the menu buttons, the landing page should scroll exactly to the beginning of the desired block (exactly where its section begins)
8. It would be more realistic if the "Buy" button was active and clickable (for example, it could scroll the page to a contact form)
9. The video should work. If it is not working, it can confuse the recruiter/user, because then it is not clear why it is on the landing page.
10. It is important that in the email field the user has the opportunity to enter the whole mail and the text is not cut off
11. All the social icons in the footer should be clickable and open the Crazybaby social networks in a new tab
